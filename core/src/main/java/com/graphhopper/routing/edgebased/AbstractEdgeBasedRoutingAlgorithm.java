/**
 * Shared methods for all edge-based algorithms. Edge-based algorithms need to consider the
 * direction of an edge. Therefore edge-based algorithms are not using the usual edge-id, but a
 * decorated edge-id. An edge in forward direction will get the usual edge id, an edge in backward
 * direction will get the edge id with its first bit on 1. The direction of an edge is determined by
 * comparing the ids of base and adjacent node.
